Assignment 3 Aim: 
Design and implement a database that solves a specific problem as per your chosen theme.

Remember to come up with a unique creative problem or scenario and show real-life expected use of your database!

Marks:
A. Designing and creating a database in SQL (16 marks)
B. Using, querying, and updating databases in SQL (25 marks)
C. Code readability, layout, and use of best practices (6 marks)
D. Creativity (5 marks)
You should:
+ Create a database with at least 3 tables with several columns, use good naming
conventions
+ Link tables using primary and foreign keys effectively
+ Populate the database with at least 8 rows of mock data per table to show use of DML
commands. The data does not need to be real or accurate.
+ Keep in your code all commands you used to set up your database, tables, and all demo
queries. You can comment out queries you do not want to be auto run
+ Use at least 3 different data types while creating tables
+ Use at least 2 constraints while creating tables, not including primary key or foreign key
+ Use at least 3 queries to insert data
+ Use at least 5 queries to retrieve data
+ Use at least 1 query to delete data
+ Use at least 2 aggregate functions
+ Use at least 2 joins
+ Use at least 2 additional in-built functions (to the two aggregate functions already
counted in previous point)
+ Use data sorting for majority of queries with ORDER BY
+ Create and use one stored procedure or function to achieve a goal
+ Normalise the DB by splitting the data out in tables where appropriate and not
containing any duplicate data.
+ Provide a creative scenario of use
